I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2026. I am a Roblox game developer and have been programming, modeling, and animating on Roblox for 5 years. I am working on my personal game on Roblox, as well as a game with my teammates.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 9, Part 2
    I liked this part of this lab because it taught me the difference between the char data type and the string data type. It also incorporated an interesting premise, which was the dining philosophers problem, where the philosophers’ schedules should never have them eating at the same time. This was more meaningful to me than simply taking averages or performing obscure calculations on numbers.

* Lab 11, Part 2
    I enjoyed this part of this lab because it was the first time in this course where we made a game that had any form of replayability. We learned to use pseudorandom number generation to create a Hi-Lo game where players have to guess the chosen number. Since it was randomly generated, it could actually be played in a way where the player doesn’t already know the number and would have to truly guess.

* Lab 12
    This lab was one of my favorites because we created gif files using code by looping through each pixel in each frame. This allowed us to finally create a visual product with our code. This would be a very fundamental step in learning to program video games with interactive visual environments, which is very cool.
